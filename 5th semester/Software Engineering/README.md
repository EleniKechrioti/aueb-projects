## ***Software requirements*** in text format

The two stakeholders of our system, the direct users,
are the customers and employers of the business.

The company's staff will have the possibility to modify the list of components, adding, removing and changing the characteristics of the products (price, name, etc.) as well as the offered required ports for their operation.

Customers will be able to search for individual products and formulations as well as learn related information about them. They will also be able to create their own PC compositions, save them for future purchase, publish them and evaluate the compositions of others. Finally, customers can add individual parts and assemblies to their shopping cart and complete the purchase by filling in the billing information on the relevant form.

In order for the composition storage process to be implemented, the system should store as well as retrieve the storage information for each personalized user. To implement the publication and evaluation of compositions, the system should store and update the list of components appropriately. Also, to make the purchase, the system should check if the composition meets the compatibility and completeness conditions. Otherwise it will prompt the user to modify their composition.
