# Othello-Reversi

Othello Reversi is a java based game build with graphics for our Artificial Intelligence course at AUEB. 
Othello is a two-player game, and here the player plays against the AI, which is implemented with the Minimax algorithm using a-b pruning.
Our report and source code can be found in the repository [Othello-Riversi](https://github.com/EleniKechrioti/Othello-Reversi). 

More information on the repository linked above.

## Features
- Responsive AI using MinMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
- Customizable depth for the MinMax algorithm, selected by the user (1-5 can be visualized as difficalty level)
- Adaptable turn-user can choose if he wants to play first or second
- Possible valid moves for the user are provided, to help him play easier
