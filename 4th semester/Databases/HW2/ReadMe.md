## Exercise 2:
In this exercise we essentially built Movielens. 
We were given files in csv format, which we imported through the SQL Server Import extension to create the tables. We were also given the file "keywords.csv" which contained keywords for each movie in json format, and we had to "split" that into 2 files
* the keyword
* the haskeyword
via python
Finally, we created primary and foreign keys for the tables (not all, this is the subject of the 4th task)
